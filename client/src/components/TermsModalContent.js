          ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING CAREFULLY:
          <ul>
            <li>
              a) Purpose. <br />
            </li>
            <p>
              Arbitration facilitates the prompt and efficient resolution of any
              disputes that may arise between you and AVP. Arbitration is a type
              of dispute resolution where the parties engage an arbitrator to
              weigh in on their dispute instead of having such dispute settled
              in court by a judge or jury trial. You can opt-out of this
              Arbitration Agreement (as explained below) to maintain your right
              to litigate your disputes in court.
            </p>
            <p>
              By entering into this Arbitration Agreement, you agree to waive
              your right to litigate your claims in front of a judge or jury and
              in arbitration, there is typically no court review of an
              arbitration award. The arbitrator must make a decision based off
              of what is written in this Arbitration Agreement.
            </p>
            <p>
              For the purpose of this Arbitration Agreement, "AVP" means AVP and
              its parents, subsidiaries, and affiliated companies, and each of
              their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents. The
              term "Dispute" means any dispute, claim, or controversy between
              you and AVP regarding any aspect of your relationship with AVP and
              is to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be
              enforced.
            </p>
            <p>
              WE AGREE THAT ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, WHETHER BASED ON ACTS OR
              OMISSIONS IN THE PAST OR FUTURE, WILL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY AND
              FINALLY BY BINDING ARBITRATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS ARBITRATION
              AGREEMENT.
            </p>
            <li>
              b) Exclusions From Arbitration And Your Right To Opt Out. <br />
              <p>
                You have the option to bring a Dispute in court and not by
                arbitration if (a) the Dispute qualifies, it may be initiated in
                small claims court in your state of residence; or (b) YOU
                OPT-OUT OF THESE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES WITHIN 30 DAYS FROM THE
                DATE THAT YOU FIRST CONSENT TO THIS AGREEMENT. You may opt out
                of this Arbitration Agreement by mailing written notification to
                AVP, 1300 Quail St. #200, Newport Beach, California 92660. Your
                opt-out notice must include your full name and your clear intent
                to opt-out of binding arbitration.{" "}
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              c) JAMS. <br />
              <p>
                JAMS will arbitrate all Disputes in front of a single
                arbitrator. The arbitration will be an individual arbitration
                and under no circumstances will the arbitration be commenced as
                a class arbitration. The arbitrator will decide all issues
                brought by the parties. In the event this Arbitration Agreement
                conflicts with the arbitration rules, this Arbitration Agreement
                will govern. You agree that these Terms affect interstate
                commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA") should
                govern the arbitrability of all Disputes.{" "}
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              d) Process. <br />
              <p>
                You and AVP agree that any Dispute must be commenced within one
                (1) year of the date the Dispute arose or else the claim is
                permanently barred. You and AVP agree that (a) any arbitration
                will occur in Orange County, California, (b) arbitration will be
                conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator and (c) that the
                state or federal courts of the State of California and the
                United States, respectively, sitting in Orange County,
                California, have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the
                enforcement of an arbitration award. If applicable, you also
                have the option to litigate a Dispute in the small claims court
                in the county of your address.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              e) Class Action Waiver. <br />
              <p>
                You and AVP agree that there will be no class arbitration or
                arbitration in which an individual person attempts to resolve a
                Dispute as a representative of other individuals. You and AVP
                agree that Disputes cannot be resolved as class actions, whether
                by arbitration, litigation, or otherwise.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              f) Severability. <br />
              <p>
                If any portion of this Arbitration Agreement (other than the
                Class Action Waiver clause above) is found to be illegal or
                unenforceable, that portion will be severed from this
                Arbitration Agreement, and the remainder of this Arbitration
                Agreement will be given full force and effect.{" "}
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              g) Survival. <br />
              <p>
                This Arbitration Agreement shall survive the termination of your
                contract with AVP and your use of the App and services.
